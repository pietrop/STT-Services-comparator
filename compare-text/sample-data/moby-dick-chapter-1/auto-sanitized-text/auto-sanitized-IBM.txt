moby dick or the whale by herman melville chapter one looe means call me ishmael some years ago never mind how long precisely having little or no money in my purse and nothing particularly interesting on shore i thought i would say about a little and see the water part of the world it's all a half of driving off the spleen and regulating circulation whenever i find myself growing greener but the most whenever it's a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral in it and especially one of my high school section of hand of me it requires a strong moral principles to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street unfortunately knocking people's heads off then i account it high time to get to see as soon as i can this is my substitute for personal and all with a philosophical flourish cato throws himself on his sword i quietly take to that's not surprising in this if it knew it almost all in a degree sometime or other cherish their new lives and feelings towards the ocean with me then now is your insolence city of the matters belted around by walks as indian ourselves by coral reefs commerce surrounds it with us uh right and left streets taking water would it's extremely downturn is the battery well that noble is washed by waves and cooled by bruises which a few hours previous were out of sight of land look crowds of watergate as the circumambulation city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from colleagues hook to county slip and from thence by white walls would silent sentinels all around town stand persons and thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean rigorous some leaning against the spoiled some seated upon the heads some looking over the books ships from china some high and often the rigging is striving to get uh still better see what people these are all lanzmann of the week days pent up and leave the tied to countries nails dimensions clenched desk how then is this other green fields gone what do you think he but look he becomes more crowds piecing straight forward and seemingly button for dive strange nothing will content and but the extremist limit of the land loitering under the shade and the underwear houses will not suffice now they must get just as neither water as it possibly can without warning and then the standard miles of the leagues and as all they come from lanes and alleys streets and avenues most east and west here we all unite honey as the magnetic virtue of needles of the competence of all those ships attract and the once more serena country and some high land leagues take almost any path you please ten to one it carries you down and uh dale and leaves you thereby approved industry there is magic in it the most absent minded and plunged his deepest references stan the man and his legs citistreet going and he will invariably lead you to water if water the vehicle that region should you ever be a first in the great american desert try this experiment if your caravan happened is supplied with the metaphysical professor yes and everyone knows meditation and water i waited for ever but he's an artist he decides to paint you dreams to shady as quiet as most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the value of this what is the chief element he implied the standard streets each with a hollow trunk the mission the crucifix within and here's sleeps his murder andreas keeps cattle up and down the cottage was sleepy smirk deep into distant woodlands winds an amazing way reaching into overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in the hillside blue but the picture lies the restaurants and through this pinetree shakes down it's eyes like leaves on the ship yet all were very unless shepherds are with upon the magic screamed for him go visit the prairies in june when the scores and scores of miles he weighed needed money targeted still one chanting it's not a drop of water when i hear about uh cataracts and would you travel sites miles to see it why did cooperative tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy account which is sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy sodom sometime after crazy to go to see my opinion first which is a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration went first told you and your ship on now of sight of land why did the old persians who seem really why did the greeks give it a separate entity and on the verge of surely all this is not without meaning and still keep the meaning of that story and asks because he could not grasp the tormenting my old images so in the fountain plunged into it understand that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans it is the image of the un grasp doubled phantom of life and this is the key to it all now when i say that i'm in the habit of going to see whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be of conscious of my lungs i do not need to have it in for that ever could see the passenger for to go as a passenger us news have a purpose and uh purses barack missing something in it besides passengers get seasick grow quarrelsome densely and now it's down to enjoy themselves much agenda of no i never goes past nor do i am something of the sort to evict sees a common europe captain cook i abandon the glory and distinction such offices to those who like them for my part i believe all honourable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind whatsoever it's quite as much as i could take care of myself without taking care of ships box bring schooners and whatnot and as we going to cope though i confess there is a considerable glory and amateur cooking sort of officer and ship pulled yet somehow i never fancied broiling files dow once broiled judiciously button judge matica salted and peppered there's no one who will speak more respectfully not say reverential abroad filed and i will it is actually i don't trust duties of the old objections upon broiled in this interesting revolves there you see the monies of those creatures in the huge big houses the minutes now when i could see i goes simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle laughed there to the royal masthead true the rather ordinary about suddenly jumped from spot to spot like a grasshopper and may lead at first this sort of thing is and isn't enough it touches one sense of honor particularly if you come of an old established family and learned the van rensselaer's wh randolph so hard commutes and more than all it just previous to putting your hand and the top part you've been loading it as a country school master making the tallest boy standing all of you the transition is taking on i wish you from schoolmaster sailor and requires a strong decoction of senegal and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but in this way as often what of it is arnold hunks of sea captain ordered me to get a broom and sweep the decks what is that indignity amount to wait i mean scales of the new testament using the arkangel gabriel thinks anything less of me because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance who aimed sleeve tony that well however the l c captains mailed me about however they make up and punch me about in the satisfaction of knowing that it's alright that everybody else is one way or other served much the same way either in physical or metaphysical point of view that and so the universal fund is passed around an all hands rub each other's shoulder blades and the content again i would like to see is a failure because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas the never pay passengers a single penny the on the contrary passengers themselves mistake and is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable affliction the to watch these entailed upon us but being paid what you compared the uh been activity with which a man receives money is really marvelous considerably so earnestly believe money to get rid of all of the ills and on no account the money man into heaven our how carefully we consign solved petition finally i would like to see as a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air the forecastle deck for us in this world headwinds a formal president and winced mister and that is if you never violate the green maxim so for the most part the common law on the quarterdeck get his atmosphere secondhand from sailors on the forecast he thinks he breathes at first but not so in much the same way to the commonality lead the leaders and many other things at the same time leaders little suspected well for was that after having repeated is not to see as a merchant sailor i should now take it into my head go whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of the fates who has the constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me influences me in some unaccountable way he cannot answer than anyone else and doubtless my going on this whaling voyage form part of the grant program of providence drawn up a long time ago it came in a sort of with interviewed and solo between more extensive performances i take it that this part of the bill must run something like this grant contested election for the presidency of the united states whaling voyage by one shy or bloody battle in afghanistan so i can't tell where it was exactly the stage managers the fates put leader of this shabby part will enjoy it when others set down for magnificent parts and i tragedies in short and easy parts and genteel comedy is enjoying parts in forces and i cannot tell why this was exactly yet another record and the circumstances conceal little into the springs and motives which being coming presented me under various disguises induced me to set about performing that part i did besides going into the solution that it was a choice resulting from my own on by history will discriminating judgements chief among these motives with the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself such a potent and mysterious monster rust all my curiosity then wild and distance sees where he wrote his island bulk the undeliverable nameless paroles the whale these with all the attending novels uh thousand patagonian sights and sounds hoped to sway me to my wish with other men that such things were not endorsements they asked me i'm twenty with everlasting h things remote i love to sail forbidden seasoned land on bars coasts not knowing what is good and quick to see the horror and could still be social with it within let me sensitised welcome on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in by reason of these things the whaling voyages welcome the great flood gates of the wonder world swung open and in the wild concedes fits with me to my purpose tune in to the afflicted into my inmost soul in the sessions of the whale and most of all one grand who did phantom let us know hillier
